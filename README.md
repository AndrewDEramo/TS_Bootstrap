This page contains:
  1) A forecasting demonstration using gradient boosting algorithm, which was requested by a colleague who wanted to understand this approach as an alternative to more common statistical autoregressive methods on univariate time series data
  2) A function for the creation of simulated time series data to enable the application of bagging ensemble methods as a way of improving both the point forecast and the prediction intervals, on average (the statistical steps are commented in the code)
